Research Methodology
The study utilized satellite imagery to extract reflectance values. Four spectral bands were considered: blue (BLUE), green (GREEN), red (RED), and near-infrared (NIR), representing the reflectance captured by the satellite images. These four reflectance values were then used to estimate field-measured reflectance through the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) technique.

The Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is a type of artificial neural network (ANN) composed of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each neuron in a given layer is connected to every neuron in the subsequent layer through weights, and an activation function is applied to transform the outputs. This technique is commonly applied in tasks such as predicting reflectance values.
