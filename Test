Aboveground biomass (AGB) is a key indicator for assessing ecosystem resources, yet traditional field-based surveys are constrained by time, cost, and limited spatial coverage. This study aims to develop an approach for estimating AGB using satellite imagery by integrating spectral reflectance and vegetation indices with machine learning techniques to construct accurate predictive models. The research process began with the collection and preprocessing of satellite images to calculate key vegetation indices. These indices were then used to build and compare multiple statistical and machine learning models, allowing the identification of the most effective predictive framework. Furthermore, a web-based application was developed to enable users to upload satellite imagery, define areas of interest, and process vegetation indices that feed into the selected model for AGB prediction. The findings demonstrate that this approach significantly reduces the reliance on labor-intensive field surveys while enhancing the speed and accuracy of biomass estimation. In addition, the method proves effective for large-scale applications, supporting both ecosystem carbon assessment and natural resource management. This research highlights the potential of integrating remote sensing with machine learning to advance sustainable monitoring practices and decision-making in ecological management.
