In this study, satellite imagery was used to extract reflectance values. Four spectral bands were considered: blue (BLUE), green (GREEN), red (RED), and near-infrared (NIR), representing the reflectance captured by the satellite images. These four reflectance values were then employed to estimate field-measured reflectance using the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) technique.

The Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is a type of artificial neural network (ANN) consisting of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each neuron in a layer is connected to every neuron in the subsequent layer through weights, and an activation function is applied to transform the outputs. This technique is commonly used for tasks such as predicting reflectance values.

Reflectance values are important for identifying surface characteristics, such as vegetation type, plant density, and plant health. By analyzing reflectance across different spectral ranges, both visible bands (BLUE, GREEN, RED) and invisible bands (NIR) can provide accurate information about vegetation properties.
