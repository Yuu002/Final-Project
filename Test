Above-ground biomass (AGB) is a key indicator for assessing ecosystem resources, yet traditional field surveys remain limited by time, cost, and spatial coverage. This study develops a method for estimating AGB using satellite imagery by combining spectral reflectance and vegetation indices with machine learning techniques. The process begins with collecting and preprocessing satellite data to derive essential vegetation indices, which are then used to build and compare multiple statistical and machine learning models. The most effective model is selected for practical application. To enhance usability, a web-based application was developed, allowing users to upload satellite images, define an area of interest, and generate AGB predictions based on the selected model. The results demonstrate that this approach reduces the need for extensive field surveys, improves both efficiency and accuracy, and is scalable to large areas. Moreover, it provides a valuable tool for carbon assessment and broader ecosystem management.
