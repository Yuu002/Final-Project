Although reflectance values from satellite imagery are embedded within each pixel and can be extracted directly, these values do not represent the exact field-measured reflectance. This discrepancy arises from several factors, such as the scattering and absorption of light in the atmosphere, which can reduce image clarity and cause deviations between the measured reflectance and the actual surface reflectance [6]. In addition, surface reflection and the satellite’s viewing angle also influence the recorded reflectance values [7].

To address this issue, a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network was applied. The satellite-derived reflectance values—blue (BLUE), green (GREEN), red (RED), and near-infrared (NIR)—were used as input variables for the MLP. The MLP consists of an input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer, where each node is fully connected to the next layer through weights. The inputs are processed through activation functions to approximate field reflectance values more accurately, as summarized in Table 1.

Table 1: Evaluation of MLP Model Performance for Satellite-Derived Reflectance

According to Table 1, the coefficient of determination (R²) ranges from 0.023 to 0.344, the root mean square error (RMSE) ranges from 1.242 to 9.207, and the mean absolute error (MAE) ranges from 1.046 to 7.341. Among the four reflectance bands, B4 (NIR) achieved the highest coefficient of determination (R² = 0.344), followed by B2 (Green), B3 (Red), and B1 (Blue), respectively.

The MLP model used for predicting field reflectance demonstrated effective approximation capability. On the test dataset, the model achieved an average loss of 1.3137 and an average error of 0.9274, indicating that the predictions were closely aligned with actual field reflectance, with an average deviation of approximately 0.93 units.

The field reflectance values estimated by the MLP model were then used to compute five vegetation indices. These indices subsequently served as input variables for the biomass prediction model to estimate above-ground biomass (AGB) within the study area.
