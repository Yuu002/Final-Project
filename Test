Research Objectives
	1.	To examine the relationship between vegetation indices derived from satellite imagery and aboveground biomass (AGB).
	2.	To construct and compare AGB prediction models using both traditional statistical methods and machine learning techniques.
	3.	To develop a web-based application that facilitates convenient, rapid, and user-friendly AGB prediction.

Research Hypotheses
	1.	Vegetation indices derived from satellite imagery can be employed to predict aboveground biomass with greater accuracy and efficiency than relying solely on conventional field-based surveys.
	2.	Machine learning models can provide superior predictive performance for aboveground biomass compared to basic statistical models.
