Above-ground biomass (AGB) plays a critical role in ecosystem assessment and carbon stock estimation. Traditional field-based measurements, however, are time-consuming, costly, and spatially limited. This study proposes an approach to estimate AGB from satellite imagery using vegetation indices in combination with machine learning techniques. Five vegetation indices—NDVI, TNDVI, SR, SAVI, and MSAVI2—were calculated from processed satellite data and used as predictors in model construction. Several machine learning algorithms were tested and compared to identify the most accurate model for biomass prediction. A web-based application was also developed to facilitate practical use, enabling users to upload satellite images, select an area of interest, and obtain biomass estimates through the trained model. The findings suggest that the proposed method offers improved efficiency and accuracy compared to traditional surveys, while supporting large-scale ecosystem monitoring and carbon assessment.
